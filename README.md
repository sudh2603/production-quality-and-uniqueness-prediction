# production-quality-and-uniqueness-prediction

# Abstract
The Main purpose of this work is to predict the quality of the new product before starting manufacturing process as well as comparing the upcoming product with the other products that are already established in the market. I am proposing a two-step method that will help us to understand the quality and uniqueness of the new product, in the first step we are analysing the data of the product and using the    K-nearest neighbour technique for predicting the quality of the product and in the second step we are trying to compare that products using correlation and Spectral Co-clustering method. After the analysis of data and it visualization, we are able to get the idea of the quality and uniqueness of the product in the market.

# Components of repository
"wine.csv" is the dataset collected from information service of “The University of Edinburgh”

"Wine Correlations.html" is the result generated after completion of prediction. It show the uniqueness of one sample w.r.t to multiple sample of the dataset using data visualization technique

"new_kNN.py" is the my self made k-NN algorithm use for prediction.

"comparision.py" is the script used perdict and analyse the uniqueness of a sample w.r.t to other existing samples.

"operation.py" is the main script used to find the quality and unqiueness of the samples. This script used to full-fill our aim of our project.
